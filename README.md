# Distributed ML on AWS Cloud: Computing with CPUs and GPUs     

## Introduction

Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services (such as computing power, storage, and databases) from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, ...

This git help you achieve single machine computation and distributed (multiple) machine computation on AWS, with both CPU and GPU execution. Here is a table of contents including all applications we have. 

## Table of Contents

- CPU Executions
  - Web-based 
    - [Web based execution for a single CPU without docker](./cpu-example/Web-based-CPU-example-with-script.md) 
    - [Web based execution for CPU(s) with docker](./cpu-example/Web-based-CPU-example-with-docker.md) 
  - Boto-based
    - [Boto based execution for a single CPU without docker](./cpu-example/Boto-based-CPU-example-without-docker.md)
- GPU Executions

For instructions of CPU executions and GPU exectutions, please go to folders *cpu-example* and *gpu-example*.
