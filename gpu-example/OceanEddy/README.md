## What is Ocean Eddy?
Ocean circulation is turbulent and full of small-scale structures. The term eddy refers to a circular current of water or air that appears to be an anomaly of the large-scale background flow. Coherent eddies in the ocean are temporary loops of swirling water that can travel long distances before dissipating. The size of ocean eddies cover a broad range between several kilometers to hundreds of kilometers.

Using CNN and cloud-based infrastructure may significantly reduce the technical challenges for a global survey of these small-scale eddies.
